1. The only known issue is regarding testing our code, when we run Client.py on our personal computer and Server.py on X2GO machine it works. However when we do it in reverse (Client.py on X2GO and Server.py on personal) it does not work. This is the only known issue it displays either: error message "socket.error: Err111 Connection Refused" or "socket.error: [Errno 110] Connection timed out." Not sure if this is a firewall issue but that's what we are assuming. 

2. We both felt that understanding the functions for sockets was hard to fully grasp as we were not very familiar and only got a brief introduction, we had to use many resources to fully understand how it worked but it still took some time. I wish more time was spent on what it meant for a socket to listen and more on a socket object; Also more about why the server is considered more complex and why it needs a loop. This project took about 2-3 days.
