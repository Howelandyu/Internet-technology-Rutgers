We used python2
1. At our result.txt, the bbc.co.uk. can output same ip addresses with the result.txt in sakai. But these ip addresses at both result.txt do not connect with bbc.co.uk. 
And the facebook.com cannot get "Not Found". I think the reason is that the facebook.com is dynamic ip address. 

2. Our problem is that there are more functions than last time, and we take much time familier these function. But We do not use struct in my Server.py. Moreover, we also take much time to understand the blog about hand writing dns messages. We take more than one week for this project.
